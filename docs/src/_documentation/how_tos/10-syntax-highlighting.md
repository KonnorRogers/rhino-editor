Syntax Highlighting! Good luck doing this in Trix!

As with everything in Rhino there are 2 parts:

1. Add to our frontend editor
1. Make sure we permit tags, attributes, styles, etc in ActionText.

Luckily for us, we don't need to do the second part! The syntax highlighter we'll be using from TipTap only uses `<span>`, `<pre>`, and `<code>` which are already permitted by default in ActionText.

TipTap provides an official extension using [Lowlight](https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight)

<https://tiptap.dev/api/nodes/code-block-lowlight>

## Installation

Assuming you have Rhino installed and working, let's start by installing the additional dependencies we need.

```bash
yarn add lowlight @tiptap/extension-code-block-lowlight hast-util-to-html he
```

## Adding to RhinoEditor


The first step is to add JavaScript to enhance our editor. Also of note we need to disable
the built-in `codeBlock` extension.

<% syntax_highlight_js_file = "frontend/javascript/entrypoints/syntax-highlighting.js" %>

```js
<%= File.read(syntax_highlight_js_file).chomp.html_safe %>
```

The next step is to choose a theme. I went with the `OneDark` theme, but feel free to choose any theme you wish.

<% syntax_highlight_css_file = "frontend/javascript/entrypoints/syntax-highlighting.css" %>

```css
<%= File.read(syntax_highlight_css_file).chomp.html_safe %>
```

<% content = "<pre><code class='highlight-js'>console.log('Hello World')</code></pre>".html_safe %>

<script type="module">
// Sometimes inputs get cached. We need to fix that.
document.querySelector("#syntax-highlight-input").setAttribute("value", "<%= content %>")
</script>

<style type="text/css" data-turbo-track="reload">
<%= File.read(syntax_highlight_css_file).chomp.html_safe %>
</style>

<% html = capture do %>
<input type="hidden" class="rhino-editor-input" id="syntax-highlight-input" value="<%= content %>">
<rhino-editor id="syntax-highlight-editor" input="syntax-highlight-input"></rhino-editor>
<% end %>

```html
<%= html.chomp.html_safe %>
```

<%= html %>

For additional themes, you can checkout the [HighlightJS](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) repo which Lowlight uses internally. The link for the CSS themes is below:
