# Welcome to your project's Gemfile, used by Rubygems & Bundler.
#
# To install a plugin, run:
#
#   bundle add new-plugin-name -g bridgetown_plugins
#
# This will ensure the plugin is added to the correct Bundler group.
#
# When you run Bridgetown commands, we recommend using a binstub like so:
#
#   bin/bridgetown start (or console, etc.)
#
# This will help ensure the proper Bridgetown version is running.
