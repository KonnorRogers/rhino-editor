# Purpose

To create a grab and go WYSIWYG editing experience that can
hook into Ruby on Rails ActionText backend. Currently this
package does so using [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) but
will most likely include another integration for [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)
to allow for both Markdown + WYSIWYG editing.

## Documentation

<https://rhino-editor.vercel.app>

## Local Development

> This section is for contributing to Rhino Editor.

Getting up and running locally is hopefully quite painless.
We have a test suite using Ruby on Rails and is intended to
provide a good demonstration of how this package can hook
into ActionText.

Contributions should be made on a feature branch in a 
forked repository.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.1.2
- Rails 7.0.4
- PNPM (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Playwright (`npm install -g playwright`)
- Node >= 16
- Docker (Used to run a simulated S3 server)
- A Docker virtualizer ([Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) or
  [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Overmind (Preferred, not needed `gem install overmind`)

### Installation

Run the following commands in the bash to setup
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konnorrogers/rhino-editor
cd rhino-editor
pnpm run setup
```

### Running the server

The easiest way to run the server is using [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind).
First start up your Docker virtualizer, then in two termainalsâ€¦

Terminal 1:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd tests/rails
overmind start -f Procfile.dev
```

Then navigate to `localhost:5100`


#### Without Overmind

To run the server without Overmind do the following in
seperate terminals:

```bash
bin/vite dev --clobber
bin/rails s
docker compose up --build
```

Then navigate to `localhost:5100`

### Running the test suite

Make sure to have the docker server up and running, the
test suite will fail without it.

```bash
docker compose up --build
bundle exec rails test:all
```

### Listening for changes to the package

To listen for changes, keep your rails server running and
open a new terminal with the following:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

This will start an ESBuild watcher process. Vite in Rails
will automatically pick up changes.

## Adding a changelog entry

To add a changelog entry, we use <https://github.com/changesets/changesets>.
Run the following command and then answer the prompts:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```
